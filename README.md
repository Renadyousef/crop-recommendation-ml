Farmers often need to measure soil properties like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and pH to determine the best crop to plant. However, testing all of these can be costly and time-consuming, especially under budget constraints.
In this project, a farmer has provided a dataset (soil_measures.csv) containing:
"N": Nitrogen level
"P": Phosphorus level
"K": Potassium level
"pH": Soil pH value
"crop": The most suitable crop for those soil conditions
The goal is to:
Use multi-class classification machine learning models to predict the optimal "crop" based on individual soil features
Determine which single soil feature is most predictive of crop selection.
