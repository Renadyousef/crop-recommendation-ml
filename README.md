Farmers often need to measure soil properties like nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and pH to determine the best crop to plant. However, testing all of these can be costly and time-consuming, especially under budget constraints.

In this project, a farmer has provided a dataset (soil_measures.csv) containing:

"N": Nitrogen level

"P": Phosphorous level

"K": Potassium level

"pH": Soil pH value

"crop": The most suitable crop for those soil conditions

goal is to:

Use multi-class classification macnine learning models to predict the optimal "crop" based on individual soil features

Determine which single soil feature is most predictive of crop selection
